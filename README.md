# Java Sorting Programs

## Repository for Project 4 and 5 : CSC6301 Software Design and Documentation
This repository contains two simple Java programs designed to demonstrate basic data structure usage and sorting logic.

## Repo Contents
### StackSort.java
This program has been reused and modified from CSC6013, translated from Python to Java.
 * This program reads integers from standard input,
 * stores them in a Stack sorted in ascending order,
 * and displays the contents of the Stack by popping elements.

### linkedList.java
This program has been reused and modified from CSC6013, translated from python to java.
 * This program reads integers from standard input,
 * stores them in a LinkedList sorted in ascending order,
 * and displays the contents of the list.

## How To Run
### To Compile:
javac StackSort.java
javac linkedList.java

### To Execute
java StackSort
java linkedList.java

## Notes
Both programs are intended for educational purposes and demonstrate sorting operations in Java.
The programs are designed to run via the command line and do not require an IDE.
